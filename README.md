Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning (Seaborn Dataset)



## 📌 Note

# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction – My First ML Project

This is my **first machine learning project**, built using the **Seaborn Titanic dataset**.  
The goal was to explore how different features like passenger class, age, and gender affect survival — and to learn how to apply basic ML techniques to a real dataset.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Understand data preprocessing and handling missing values
- Apply and compare common classification models
- Practice model evaluation using accuracy and F1 score

---

## 🧠 Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

---

## 📊 Model Results

| Model              | Accuracy | F1 Score |
|-------------------|----------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 80.34% | 0.7518   |
| KNN                 | 79.21% | 0.7413   |
| GaussianNB          | 77.53% | 0.7297   |
| Decision Tree       | 79.78% | 0.7429   |
| **SVC**             | **82.02%** | **0.7714** ✅

---

## 🧪 Techniques Applied

- Data cleaning (e.g., filling missing `age` and `embarked`)
- Encoding categorical variables like `sex`, `embarked`
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
- Model training, testing, and comparison

---

## 🚀 What I Plan to Improve

As this is just my starting point, I’m planning to improve this project by:

- ➕ Creating new features like `FamilySize` and `IsAlone`
- 📊 Binning features like `age` and `fare` into categories
- 🔍 Tuning hyperparameters using `GridSearchCV`
- 🌐 Trying to deploy the model using Streamlit

These will help me better understand how feature engineering and tuning impact real models.

---

## 📚 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`

## 💬 Final Thoughts

I’ve learned a lot from this beginner project and know there’s still so much more to explore.  
If you have any suggestions, I’d love to hear them — I’m always open to learning and improving. 😊

Thanks for checking it out!
